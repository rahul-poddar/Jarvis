# Jarvis

Jarvis is a virtual assistant program that allows users to interact with their computers using voice commands. It was inspired by the character of the same name from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The Jarvis package consists of several modules: body, data, brain, database, and feature.\

## Installation
Jarvis can be installed by cloning the GitHub repository and installing the required dependencies using pip. To do this, follow these steps:
> `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git`

## Usage
To use Jarvis, run the **`Jarvis.py`** script. This script imports the *`jarvis`* module, which contains the main functionality of the program.

The *`jarvis`* module uses the other modules in the package to perform tasks. Here is an overview of the modules:

+ **body:** This module contains functions for interacting with the user's computer, such as opening applications and sending keystrokes.
+ **data:** This module contains functions for retrieving data from external sources, such as the weather or news.
+ **brain:** This module contains the main logic of the program, including parsing user commands and determining appropriate responses.
+ **database:** This module contains functions for storing and retrieving data from a local database.
+ **feature:** This module contains additional functionality that can be added to Jarvis, such as controlling smart home devices or playing music.
